### Abstract 

This paper presents a novel strategy to detect and classify adult whiteflies and five important related stages on images of detached soybean leaves. The whitefly species _Bemisia tabaci_ is a major pest in soybean crops, and by detecting, counting and differentiating  its related life stages in field collected leaves control management decisions can be made.  The proposed solution is based on a deep learning object detection algorithm, modified into an specific new learning strategy with innovations on data augmentation, image mosaicking, and fusion of hypothesized object categories. A real and annotated dataset of images is provided, together with experimental results that showed a promising performance of the proposed system in comparison with a competitive convolutional neural network algorithm. The overall strategy could be extended to work in other similar tasks for image based pest management.
